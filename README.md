# 📘 SQA Business Analyst Resource Hub — Anirvan Vinod

Welcome to the **SQA Resource Hub**, a purpose-built Business Requirements Document (BRD) that positions me, **Anirvan Vinod**, as a strategic solution to the evolving analytical needs of the **Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA)** during its transition to **Qualifications Scotland**.

This project is both a **portfolio** and a **demonstration of business analysis in action** — designed to be accessible, user-friendly, and professionally relevant to hiring managers, analysts, and decision-makers.
